This is a simple C++ console program that manages a TikTok Review Database using arrays and file input/output (I/O).

The program lets you:

- View all TikTok trend/influencer reviews
- Search for a trend or influencer by name (case-insensitive)
- Add new reviews
- Store all reviews in a text file so they stay saved between runs

All data is stored in a file called "tiktok_reviews.txt".
